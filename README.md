# Analysis-of-Zomato-User-Ratings
# Description:- 
  In this Power BI project, an in-depth analysis of Zomato user ratings was conducted using the dataset Eatery_TrainingData.csv. The process began with loading the data into Power BI. The ETL process involved cleaning and refining specific columns for better data comprehension. New columns were created to enhance the analysis, such as book URL presence, the number of cuisines, segmenting by the number of cuisines, refined user rating text, grouped Zomato user ratings, and refined table booking and online delivery status.
  Following the data preparation, a comprehensive dashboard was created to visualize the insights. Key performance indicators included the total number of restaurants in India, the total number of cuisines, and the total customer rating votes for restaurants. Various charts were utilized to present the data effectively: a pie chart showed the distribution of restaurants by user ratings, a bar chart compared the total number of restaurants and user ratings by city, and a map chart displayed cities by user rating votes and total cuisines. This analysis provided valuable insights into user ratings and preferences on Zomato.
